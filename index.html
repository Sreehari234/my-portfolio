  <h2>Hi, I'm Sreehari</h2>
  <p>
    I'm currently studying Electrical Engineering, and I’ve always been drawn to the intersection of hardware and software—especially when it comes to embedded systems, robotics, and smart devices. I love the challenge of making things work in the real world, whether that’s getting a sensor to behave or building an entire system from scratch.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the past few years, I’ve had the chance to work on some really exciting projects—from building a smart cradle for infants to programming autonomous robots for planetary exploration. I’ve also enjoyed mentoring fellow students in hands-on courses like Computer Architecture and Engineering Challenge for Venus, where I help troubleshoot hardware and guide students through their designs.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m passionate about turning ideas into prototypes, solving real problems with creative solutions, and constantly learning new things along the way.

        <h3>Rock Your Baby</h3>
        <p>
          A smart cradle system designed to monitor and soothe infants. I was responsible for integrating sensors (like accelerometers and IR), controlling a stepper motor for rocking, and designing software to automatically respond to a baby’s movements or crying. The system used a PYNQ board and MQTT communication to coordinate behavior and log data.

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Engineering Challenge for Venus</h3>
        <p>
          A robotics challenge simulating harsh planetary exploration. I worked on designing and maintaining a robot equipped with various sensors including ultrasound, photodiodes, and IR. Tasks involved programming autonomous behavior, debugging sensor circuits, and improving the wireless communication system. I later became a tutor for this course, helping students troubleshoot and enhance their robots.

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Wien Bridge Oscillator</h3>
        <p>
          Designed and built a 10 kHz sine wave oscillator using op-amps and a feedback network. This analog electronics project focused on stability, frequency accuracy, and amplitude control, giving me deeper insights into feedback systems and practical circuit behavior.

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Digit Classifier with Neural Networks</h3>
        <p>
          Implemented a digit recognition system using Python and Keras, trained on the MNIST dataset. Achieved over 95% accuracy by tuning network architecture and hyperparameters. This project deepened my understanding of machine learning fundamentals and neural network optimization.
